#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?
**Ans:** Let, Var, and Const are the various ways that JavaScript provides for declaration of JavaScript Variables. Var is an old way of declaring variables. Whereas, Let & Const is the new concept of declaration variables which came from the ES6 version.Var variables can be redeclared or reassigned, while let variables can only be reassigned but cannot be redeclared with the same name in the same scope and Const variables cannot be redeclared or reassigned.


#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?
**Ans:** The **map()** method is used to transform the elements of an array, whereas the **forEach()** method is used to loop through the elements of an array.The **filter()** method in JavaScript creates a new array with the elements that satisfies the provided condition.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?
**Ans:** Arrow functions are one of many new features of ES6 JavaScript.ES6 arrow functions provide an alternative way to write a shorter syntax compared to the function expression

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
**Ans:** Destructuring assignment in ES6 simplifies the process of extracting values from arrays and objects, making code more readable and concise.When we want to destructure an array, we just construct a new array with the variable we want to assign data to and set it equal to the array of data we want to destructure. one variable is assigned to each array value as the items in the array are unpacked and placed in the left-side array in the order of left to right.

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?
**Ans:** Template literals in JavaScript make string concatenation and variable interpolation easier.Template literals are more readable and maintainable than string concatenation.Template literals can contain placeholders. These are indicated by the dollar sign and curly braces **( ${expression} )**. Unlike concatenated strings, we can slot expressions directly into template literals, meaning that we can effortlessly pull values into our string.
